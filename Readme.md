# Shape

v2.0.0

![](icon.png)

> A package for computing differential geometry using _Mathematica_.

> Based on a bunch of work I've done since about 1995 or so. Bits and pieces borrowed from Koenderink, Gray, &c.

## Overview

Right now, `Shape` is broken into five sub-modules:

* DepthMapShape
* RegionShape
* ShapeMetrics
* ShapePatches
* Structure

### DepthMap

Contains routines for calculating depth-map based shape using structure tensor shenanigans.
